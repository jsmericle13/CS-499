Professional Evaluation
I am prepared for an entry-level software engineering role because my coursework and capstone portfolio demonstrate that I can take an existing application, improve it, and clearly explain the results. Over time, I’ve shifted from focusing only on whether code “runs” to focusing on software quality: maintainability, structure, readability, and responsible handling of data.
My strengths
•	Software Design & Engineering: I can design and refactor applications using separation of concerns and clean structure (for example, organizing logic into clear layers such as controller/service/model). This makes my code easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
•	Algorithms & Data Structures: I can apply data structures intentionally (such as using maps for frequency tracking) and explain the trade-offs involved. I’m comfortable improving a program’s efficiency and simplifying logic to reduce duplication and errors.
•	Databases and Data-Driven Development: I understand how to build applications that store, retrieve, and manage data using database-backed workflows. I can follow CRUD patterns and connect code to stored data in a way that supports real application behavior.
•	Professional Communication: I can communicate technical work in writing and in a code review format, explaining what I changed, why I changed it, and how it demonstrates specific skills.
How I work professionally
I approach projects with a focus on clarity and responsibility. I document decisions, keep code organized, and think about how another developer would read and maintain my work. I also consider professionalism and ethics when publishing work, such as not exposing sensitive information and using safe practices when working with data.
Areas I’m continuing to improve
I’m continuing to strengthen my testing habits (unit/integration testing), my use of performance measurement, and the completeness of my documentation. My goal is to keep building toward industry expectations by improving how I validate correctness and reliability while keeping my code clean and scalable.
Summary
Overall, my portfolio shows that I can build and enhance real software artifacts, apply core computer science concepts, and communicate my work clearly—skills I will use directly in a professional software engineering role.
